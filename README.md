# Console-Finances
This repo using what I learned in Javascript fundamentals to analyzing the financial records of a company in a real-world problems. I have been provided with a financial dataset file.
## Description
Write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * You will need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average.
  * (`Total/Number of months`)

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

When open the code in the browser the resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

  ```text
  Financial Analysis
  ----------------------------
  Total Months: 25
  Total: $2561231
  Average  Change: $-2315.12
  Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
  ```
